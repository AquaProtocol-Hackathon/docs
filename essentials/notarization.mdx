# Notarization

Aqua Protocol provides a foundational framework for building distributed trust networks through secure notarization and verification systems.

## What is Notarization?

Notarization in Aqua Protocol refers to the process of creating an immutable, cryptographically secured record of data existence and integrity. This process ensures that:

- **Data integrity** is maintained through cryptographic hashing
- **Timestamp verification** provides proof of when data was notarized
- **Immutable records** are stored on the blockchain for permanent verification
- **Decentralized trust** eliminates reliance on centralized authorities

## How Aqua Notarization Works

### 1. Content Hashing
The first step in notarization involves creating a cryptographic hash of the content:

```javascript
import { AquaClient } from '@aqua-protocol/sdk';
import crypto from 'crypto';

const client = new AquaClient({
  apiKey: process.env.AQUA_API_KEY,
  endpoint: 'https://api.aqua-protocol.org/v3'
});

// Create content hash
const content = 'Document content to be notarized';
const contentHash = crypto.createHash('sha256')
  .update(content)
  .digest('hex');
```

### 2. Revision Creation
Create a file revision to notarize the content:

```javascript
const notarization = await client.createNotarization({
  content: content,
  fileHash: contentHash,
  fileNonce: crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'),
  revisionType: 'file'
});

console.log('Notarization created:', notarization.verificationHash);
```

### 3. Blockchain Witness
Add a witness revision to secure the notarization on the blockchain:

```javascript
const witness = await client.addWitness({
  previousVerificationHash: notarization.verificationHash,
  witnessNetwork: 'sepolia',
  witnessSmartContractAddress: '0x45f59310ADD88E6d23ca58A0Fa7A55BEE6d2a611'
});

console.log('Witness added:', witness.transactionHash);
```

## Notarization Types

### File Notarization
Notarize files and documents for integrity verification:

- **Document verification** for legal and business applications
- **Intellectual property** protection and timestamping
- **Compliance** and regulatory requirements
- **Audit trails** for data governance

### Content Notarization
Notarize specific content or data structures:

- **Database records** and data integrity
- **Configuration files** and system state
- **API responses** and data consistency
- **Log files** and audit trails

### Form Notarization
Special notarization for layer 2 applications:

- **Identity claims** and attestations
- **Access control** policies
- **Selective disclosure** capabilities
- **Privacy-preserving** verification

## Verification Process

Once content is notarized, it can be verified at any time:

```javascript
const verification = await client.verifyNotarization({
  verificationHash: notarization.verificationHash,
  expectedContent: content
});

if (verification.isValid) {
  console.log('Notarization verified successfully');
  console.log('Timestamp:', verification.timestamp);
  console.log('Block number:', verification.blockNumber);
} else {
  console.log('Notarization verification failed');
}
```

## Use Cases

### Legal Documents
- **Contract verification** and authenticity
- **Legal compliance** and regulatory requirements
- **Evidence preservation** for legal proceedings
- **Notary services** and document certification

### Business Applications
- **Supply chain** verification and tracking
- **Financial records** and audit trails
- **Compliance** and regulatory reporting
- **Data governance** and integrity

### Identity Management
- **Identity verification** and attestation
- **Credential management** and verification
- **Access control** and authorization
- **Privacy-preserving** identity solutions

## Best Practices

### Content Preparation
- **Normalize content** before hashing to ensure consistency
- **Include metadata** such as file names and timestamps
- **Use appropriate nonces** for additional entropy
- **Validate content** before notarization

### Security Considerations
- **Protect private keys** used for signing
- **Use secure networks** for witness transactions
- **Regular verification** of notarized content
- **Backup verification hashes** for recovery

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch operations** for multiple notarizations
- **Use appropriate networks** based on requirements
- **Monitor gas costs** for witness transactions
- **Implement caching** for frequent verifications
